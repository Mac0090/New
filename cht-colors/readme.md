# Chinese Traditional Colors

[Chinese traditional colors](https://cht-colors.pages.dev/) is a collection of colors from Chinese traditional culture.

There's also a sub page about [China painting colors](https://cht-colors.pages.dev/painting/).

The website was originaly created by [aj\_oo](http://twitter.com/aj_oo) 12 years ago.
This is the thread he announced the project: https://v2ex.com/t/481.

At the time I was a student in school,
I was keen on saving anything I like on the web,
that's how the website was kept.

As time goes by, it went down and got abandoned, just like many other good things on the Internet.

I always hate [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot), and since I now have the skill of making website,
it's time to refine this website and make it accessible again.
